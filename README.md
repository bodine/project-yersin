# Background

Hi,

Right now there's nothing here yet. Let me explain informally what this project is about. By day I'm a software security consultant. By night and weekends my partner and I are a part of the global volunteer mask making effort.

I was contacted this weekend by an associate fielding a request to me for a few dozen masks on behalf of a home for adults with disabilities.  This made my partner to question whether our masks, which tie in the back, were suitable for the folks in this home, which in turn lead me to ask how we could help the caregivers in this home make sure that masks were put on and could stay on effectively.

As it happens, Limor Fried and company of Adafruit Industries have been putting out material on thermal imaging as it relates to fever detection, etc. These commercial tools are more expensive than a small nonprofit who needs 30 free masks can afford. They are also ill suited to the concern of program compliance for mask wearing.

## Project 1

Let's build a handheld device that can help caregivers verify that masks are put on effectively. This will probably require the mask wearer to take a deep breath and let it out. This will be an altogether safer method than tugging on corners and fussing with ties.

While thinking about this project it lead me to reflect on another set of concerns that we in the mask making community have: we have a variety of designs to choose from and materials to use, but we have no way to gauge the relative effectiveness of these choices. Is one material better than another? Should some materials be avoided at all cost? Should we really be putting those nose-pinchy things on our masks? If so, what adhesives should we use and can we get by with homemade ones made from recycled aluminum?

## Project 2 
*(which might is a good prototype/MVP for Project 1)*

Let's develop an open hardware specification for a device that can validate the efficacy of different mask designs. This design should be easily buildable and should rely on open source software and widely available hardware. This might, in time, extend beyond thermal imaging and involve humidity and moisture sensors to detect particulate leakage.
